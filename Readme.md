Chosen the Cucumber-Java platform for the scenario implementation
Created a single feature file to execute the set of search strings and checks the expected results
Created the corresponding steps and assert for the searched links work properly and pages are loading
Added runner class to extract the report of the test case status
Used dependency injection and passed the pagefactory webelements to the active class
Hooks class will handle the setup and tear down to initialize and manage the driver
This solution can be extendable with the set of inputs to search with the web pages.
